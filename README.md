# Boomi's Legal Response Bot (BLRB) - Updates and extensive description of the project will be added after I am done with all my finals.

*BlRB Project Description -*
In general, the project focus was working with Dell Boomis legal team to produce an automated resolution “bot” that provides answers to commonly asked, straightforward and easily-answered questions in real-time, which will free up resources for legal department leaders to focus on more pressing – and more complicated – tasks.
