# Boomi's Legal Response Bot (BLRB) - Updates and extensive description of the project will be added after I am done with all my finals.

*BLRB Project Description -*
Boomi's Legal Response Bot project goal was to provide Dell Boomi's legal department with an automated response bot capable of reducing busywork. This would lead to improved response times, consistencies in answers and resolutions, advance customer interaction, and allocate resources to imperative deals. Its purpose is to provide answers to commonly asked, straightforward, and easily answered questions in real-time, which will free up resources for legal department leaders to focus on more pressing – and more complicated – tasks. Throughout the requirements process with the help of stakeholders, I created a BRS, SyRS, SRS, and a prototype which can be found below under the [Interactive](https://github.com/Wangola/Boomi-s-Legal-Response-Bot#interactive) section. The prototype showcases how the user can interact with the BLRB and gives some insight into how the final product may look like. This product is only for Dell personnel users who will need special accounts to access this software to maintain the integrity and privacy of Dell Boomi's legal team. If you would like a more in-depth look into the structure and idea of the project as a whole I suggest reading the [BRS](https://github.com/Wangola/Boomi-s-Legal-Response-Bot/blob/main/Pages/Main%20Pages/Business%20requirements%20specification%20(BRS).pdf), [SyRS](https://github.com/Wangola/Boomi-s-Legal-Response-Bot/blob/main/Pages/Main%20Pages/Boomi's%20Legal%20Response%20Bot%20Requirements%20Document.pdf), and [SRS](https://github.com/Wangola/Boomi-s-Legal-Response-Bot/blob/main/Pages/Main%20Pages/Boomi's%20Legal%20Response%20Bot%20Requirements%20Specification%20(SRS).pdf).
