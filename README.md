# Boomi's Legal Response Bot

*BLRB Project Description -*
Boomi's Legal Response Bot project goal was to provide Dell Boomi's legal department with an automated response bot capable of reducing busywork. This would lead to improved response times, consistencies in answers and resolutions, advance customer interaction, and allocate resources to imperative deals. Its purpose is to provide answers to commonly asked, straightforward, and easily answered questions in real-time, which will free up resources for legal department leaders to focus on more pressing – and more complicated – tasks. Throughout the requirements process with the help of stakeholders, I created a BRS, SyRS, SRS, and a prototype which can be found below under the [Interactive](https://github.com/Wangola/Boomi-s-Legal-Response-Bot#interactive) section. The prototype showcases how the user can interact with the BLRB and gives some insight into how the final product may look like. This product is only for Dell personnel users who will need special accounts to access this software to maintain the integrity and privacy of Dell Boomi's legal team. If you would like a more in-depth look into the structure and idea of the project as a whole I suggest reading the [BRS](https://github.com/Wangola/Boomi-s-Legal-Response-Bot/blob/main/Pages/Main%20Pages/Business%20requirements%20specification%20(BRS).pdf), [SyRS](https://github.com/Wangola/Boomi-s-Legal-Response-Bot/blob/main/Pages/Main%20Pages/Boomi's%20Legal%20Response%20Bot%20Requirements%20Document.pdf), and [SRS](https://github.com/Wangola/Boomi-s-Legal-Response-Bot/blob/main/Pages/Main%20Pages/Boomi's%20Legal%20Response%20Bot%20Requirements%20Specification%20(SRS).pdf).

* What is the BLRB?
  *   The BLRB is intended to be an automated response bot capable of reducing busywork by providing correct and consistent answers to commonly asked legal questions. The bases on how the software should be built have been speculated but not confirmed, programming languages such as Java, C++, and Python are a few of the languages which could be used to produce the BLRB. 
* Who made the BLRB?
  * Author: William Angola
  * The BLRB specification was mainly with the help of Edward McCarthy (Legal Counsel at Dell Technologies) and all of the stakeholders documented in the BRS.
* When was it made?
  *  This specification was made throughout my Spring semester in 2021. I had no previous software specification/documentation experience of this scale before which made it difficult at times but it was a great learning experience.
* Why did you make it?
  * The BLRB was made as a semester-long project in which its overall production being controlled by the engagement of me and my sponsor. It initially felt like an assignment but it flourished to be a pleasant experience working with real-world people to develop/theorize a potential upcoming software.* 
* Where did you make it?
  *  All documentation was created in the comfort of my own home due to covid limitations which made it difficult when trying to communicate with stakeholders around the globe. This assignment was assigned in my CEN 3073 Software Specifications course.
